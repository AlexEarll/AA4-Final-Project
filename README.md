# Battling Pokemon
### Team AA4 - Kirsten Anders, Alex Earll, Sam Otto, Soobin Kwon

> For our project, we worked towards creating a simulated battle between two pokemon that a user can choose and interact with during a battle. A shinyApp is produced in order for the user to determine how a battle will end by changing the pokemon stat levels for each pokemon. The user will also be provided different graphic visualizations to see the calculations each random move presents in battle.

> In order to use the Pokemon API, it took many hours and hard work to parse through the information, create and move the values into a CSV file. From there on, the new dataset is easy to use and wrangle in Shiny.

> The user will be able to select the two pokemon they wish to battle. Choose the pokemon base statistics and four moves will be randomly selected. The user will be able to choose which different tabsets to see which visualization of the data and calculations of the battle they wish to see.

> This app will essentially teach users that math, statistics, and coding is the base of their favorite games. We believe our video game will be mostly popular to children, which will help educate kids with statistics. However, it could also be an enjoyable experience to play for anybody.
